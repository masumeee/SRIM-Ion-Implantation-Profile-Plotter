Why This Tool Exists
Working with ion implantation data from SRIM can be tedious. Manually creating plots from .txt output files is time-consuming and often requires programming or expensive software.
The SRIM Ion Implantation Profile Plotter solves this by providing a browser-based, professional-grade tool that lets researchers quickly visualize, compare, and export their ion implantation profiles without coding skills.

Features
Upload multiple SRIM .txt files for simultaneous comparison.
Choose units: Depth in Å, nm, or µm; Concentration in atoms/cm³ or fraction.
Compare profiles visually with distinct colors and markers.
Interactive plots: zoom, pan, and hover for precise data points.
Export high-resolution PNG images for presentations, papers, or posters.
Professional scientific formatting with bold axes and log-scale Y-axis.


How It Works (4 Simple Steps)
Upload SRIM .txt output file(s).
Choose your depth and concentration units.
View interactive plots with lines and markers.
Export high-resolution figures or reset to try new files.
No installation or programming required — everything runs in your browser.

Who Can Benefit
Semiconductor researchers analyzing dopant distributions.
Students learning about ion implantation.
Engineers preparing conference posters or journal figures.
Anyone needing clean, scientific plots from SRIM data.


Getting Started
Open the tool in your browser: Launch Plotter.
Upload your SRIM .txt files.
Customize units and plot settings.
Interact with the plot and export high-quality figures.
